title: Micheal Waltz - Principal DevOps Engineer

This is my tech [blog](/blog), updated occasionally with interesting things I have done at work or off-hours. My skills primarily focus on [Cloud Native Computing](https://www.cncf.io/) and modern application deployments with tools like [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), see [about](/about) for more.

I currently work full time remotely for [Demandbase](https://www.demandbase.com), an Account Based Marketing company in San Francisco California. Previously I've worked at [Qualcomm](https://www.qualcomm.com) and the [UCSD School of Medicine](https://medschool.ucsd.edu).

After hours I enjoy being a father and husband, collecting and repairing retro video games. [Small keyboards](/images/gergoplex.jpg) are a paritcular fascination of mine. ⌨️
