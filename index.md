This is my tech [blog](/blog), updated occasionally with interesting things I have done at work or off-hours. My professional skills focus on [Cloud Native Computing](https://www.cncf.io/), modern application deployments with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), and implementing cloud technology at scale. See [about](/about) for more.

I currently lead the [Cloud Center of Excellence](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/cost-optimization-laying-the-foundation/cloud-center-of-excellence.html) at [Demandbase](https://www.demandbase.com). Previously I've worked at [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com), [TheRealReal](https://www.therealreal.com), [Qualcomm](https://www.qualcomm.com) and the [UCSD School of Medicine](https://medschool.ucsd.edu).

After hours I enjoy being a father and husband, collecting and repairing retro video games. [Small keyboards](/assets/images/gergoplex.jpg) are a paritcular fascination of mine. ⌨️
