I am a remote DevOps Engineer working at [Demandbase](https://www.demandbase.com). My day-to-day responsibilities include working with the DevOps team on maintaining our [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) infrastructure, developing [Chef](https://www.chef.io/) recipes, wrangling [Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org/) jobs, developing [Docker](https://www.docker.com) containers and deploying them to [Rancher](http://rancher.com/), and collaborating with our development and QA teams.

Afterhours I enjoy being a father and husband, collecting and playing new and retro video games, finding new places to eat on [Convoy](http://www.convoydistrict.com/eat/), and learning about technology.
