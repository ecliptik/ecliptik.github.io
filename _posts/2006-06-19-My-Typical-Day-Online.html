title: My Typical Day Online
tags: internet
---
I spend a lot of time online, some people would say it's excessive, but normally most people just ask what exactly do I spend all that time on? Instead of explaining it to each person I figured I'd write a bit about it. I have an odd way of computing which I'll explain and then follow it up with what resources I use.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">The Network is the Computer</span><br />
<br />
I'm a systems administrator by day, and one thing I'm always looking for is a way to make tasks easier. Centralizing systems and resources so I only have to do something once is the key here and I carry it over into my personal computing habits as well. I have three computers I normally us, my G3 iBook, an old Dell laptop, and a 64-bit GNU/Linux <a href="http://www.us.debian.org/">Debian</a> server. Why so many computers? Well diversity for one, they represent all three major operating systems and platforms and with the exception of cutting edge games I have all my bases covered. Also if I lose a laptop I'm not completely disabled computing wise. The server also has backups for it so we're safe there as well.<br />
<br />
The two laptops are essentially satellites of the Debian server, and they contain little to any non-recoverable data. All music, movies, pictures, documents, everything that is important, is stored on the server. I then access it through the <a href="http://www.torrentflux.com/">web</a>, encrypted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openssh">SSH</a> connections, and tunneled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vnc">VNC</a> desktop sessions. Security has a heavy focus, and any IPs that want to connect must authenticate through a webpage, as well as the use of SSL for sensitive connections. The advantage to this is as long as I have a connection to the internet I'm always  at my computer. It also allows other people I trust to connect and use various shared resources.<br />
<br />
This fits into my daily routine by logging in via SSH on my laptop or desktop at work, then tunneling VNC to my shared desktop. The shared <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xfce">desktop</a> contains my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaim">instant messenger</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K3b">cd burning app</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollon_%28GUI%29">filesharing app,</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konqueror">web browser</a>, and whatever else software debian has installed<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Sites</span><br />
<br />
Here's a list of sites I usually have loaded in a tabs or <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/livebookmarks.html">Live Bookmarks</a>:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li><a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> - I've probably learned more from comments here than I did in four years of college</li>
<li><a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/">Penny Arcade</a> - Only on Mon/Wed/Fri, but they have excellent commentary on the gaming industry</li>
<li><a href="http://mail.google.com/">Gmail</a> - Where all my personal emails are, go figure</li>
<li><a href="http://news.google.com/">Google News</a> - Gives me more mainstream current events tailored to my preferences</li>
</ol>
That's it, really not a whole lot when you break it down, but it's a good cross section of the rapidly changing webscape and there's hours of things to read and look into<br />
<br />
With the combination of the computing approach I described above and the techniques and list of sites is usually how I spend my day online.
