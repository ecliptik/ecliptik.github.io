Today I was reading the Slashdot story on<a href="http://apple.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/12/15/1332212"><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>15 Things Apple Should Change in Mac OS X</a> and I came across these excellent hints in the comments:
<ol>
    <li>Hold down on the + window button to fully maximize a window (may not work in some apps)</li>
    <li>To find the actual path of a app or file drag it into a terminal window</li>
    <li>To rename a file, select it and hit enter</li>
    <li>Create a shortcut on the dock for the Apps folder, then click-and-hold for a pop-menu of all your apps
    </li>
    <li>Shift-A will open the Apps folder if you don't want it in the dock
    </li>
    <li>Don't copy and paste, drag and drop everything, including text</li>
    <li>To put a widget permanently on the desktop, open a terminal and type: <blockquote><code>defaults write com.apple.dashboard devmode YES</code></blockquote> press F12, and while dragging a widget press F12 to drop it
    </li>
    <li>Use Command-O to launch an App or open a file</li>
    <li>To skip the"Are You Sure?" dialog. hold down the option key when choosing to shutdown</li>
    <li>Use the dock for temporary storage of files when using the drag-and-drop method of cutting-and-pasting
    </li>
</ol>
