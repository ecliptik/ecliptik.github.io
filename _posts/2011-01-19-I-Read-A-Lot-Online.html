title: I Read A Lot Online

While working my way through <a href="http://reader.google.com/">Google Reader</a> today I accidentally clicked the <i>trends</i>&nbsp;link on the left hand menu. I don't know if it just appeared recently or I just never noticed it before, but there's some interesting statistics there of items read, clicked, shared, etc. It even has friends stats for anyone you share or read items with through Reader. The stat that caught my eye though was total of items read since I started using Reader the end of 2005... almost 150,000... that's a big number.<br />
