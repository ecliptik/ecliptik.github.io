Last week I decided to make the jump from <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian </a>Sarge to Etch on my home media server. The upgrade was for the most part painless, although there were a few snags I hit that I will explain in more detail in another post. For now though I wanted to post a nice screen shot of my new <a href="http://www.xfce.org/">Xfce </a>desktop:<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="/assets/images/posts/jezebel_xfce4.png"><img width=600px style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer;" src="/assets/images/posts/jezebel_xfce4.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5033751419390493954" border="0" /></a><br />On the left is the main app panel featuring: <a href="http://dickey.his.com/xterm/">xterm</a>, <a href="http://www.k3b.org/">K3b</a>, <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMware</a>, <a href="http://gaim.sourceforge.net/">GAIM</a>, <a href="http://nostatic.org/grip/">Grip</a>, <a href="http://www.xmms.org/">XMMS</a>, <a href="http://www.exit1.org/dvdrip/">DVD::RIP</a>, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnuzilla/">Iceweasel </a>(aka <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/">Firefox</a>), and <a href="http://www.konqueror.org/">Konqueror</a>. Finally the little mouse with the X is the Xfce application menu, then hardware temperature sensors (a little high actually) and system load information. The top panel is running six virtual desktops with a taskbar on the right side. The app that is currently running is DVD::RIP in GUI mode making an Xvid video out of the Talladega Nights DVD I recently purchased.
