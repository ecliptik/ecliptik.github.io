Ever noticed you're running out of room on a partition and you'd like to free up some space quickly that may be hidden in unused directories? Here's a quick and easy way using the <code>du </code>command:
</p>
<p>
<ol>
    <li>Find the partition that's low on space and cd into it</li>
    <li>Do <code>du -sh * | grep G</code> to give a usage summary in human readable form and grepping out any dirs with a gigabyte or more</li>
    <li>Look at the results and see if there's any dirs you could remove, or go into further</li>
    <li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 until you've gone through the directory tree, removing any unnecessary files and directories</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
Sure it's only useful for large portions of space, but you could replace the G with an M to get more results. Searching for larger files over a gig is usually quicker and produces better results though.
