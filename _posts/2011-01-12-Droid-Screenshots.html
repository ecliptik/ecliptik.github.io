One of my favorite games last year was Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, and one of the cool things that came with the collectors edition was a concept art book. Today while reading Kotaku I came across a link to the concept artists <a href="http://donglu-littlefish.blogspot.com/2010/11/assassins-creed-brotherhood-concepts.html">Donglu Yu's blog</a> and found they make excellent Android wallpapers.<br />
<br />
The panning affect when moving between workspaces is really cool, and below I tried to replicate it with a few screen shots from my rooted Droid. I should also note that I used my excellent Chrome cr-48 netbook and the cloud photo editing site <a href="http://www.picnik.com/">Picnik</a> putting these images together.<br />
