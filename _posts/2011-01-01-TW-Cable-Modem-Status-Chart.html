Chart of our Time Warner cable modem going on and offline. Someone is coming out to replace the line from the alley to the house which hopefully fixes it.<br />
<br />

:Script that generated data, originally was so I could tell the cable tech when the connection dropped and then I used the data over a few days to make the above graph.<br />
<i>watch.sh</i><br />
<br />
<code>#!/bin/bash<br />
    IP=8.8.8.8<br />
    <br />
    while true; do<br />
    DATE=`date +"%D %r"`<br />
    if ping -c 1 -W 2 ${IP} 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt;/dev/null; then<br />
    echo "${DATE} - Ping successful"<br />
    else<br />
    echo "${DATE} - Ping unsuccessful"<br />
    fi<br />
    sleep 60<br />
    done
</code>
