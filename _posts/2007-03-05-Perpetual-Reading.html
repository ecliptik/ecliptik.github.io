While editing my myspace profile today (don't even get me started) I was looking at my "book" section. At the moment I have the two books that I'm currently reading, which is different from most pages that have a long list of favorite books. I was thinking if I should list my favorites instead, and when doing so came to the realization that a few of my favorite books are not just ones that I read and put away, but continuously read over and over again.

Looking back over the years and what I've kept in my laptop bag I've come up with a list of these perpetually read books:
<ul><li><a href="http://www.online-literature.com/orwell/1984/">1984</a> by George Orwell</li><li><a href="http://www.cslewis.com/books/screwtape_letters.html">Screwtape Letters</a> by C.S. Lewis</li><li><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/5">Constitution of the United States of America</a></li><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ishmael-Adventure-Spirit-Daniel-Quinn/dp/0553375407">Ishmael</a> by Daniel Quinn</li><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Horizon_%28novel%29">Lost Horizon</a> by James Hilton</li></ul>I could list these as "favorite" books, but at the same time I'm always at some point in reading them, constantly learning and understanding more about them, hence perpetual.
