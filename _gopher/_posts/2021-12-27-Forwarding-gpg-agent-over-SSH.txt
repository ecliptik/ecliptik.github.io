Basic notes from setting up [gpg-agent forwarding][] between a MacOS
and Debian Linux system.

  [gpg-agent forwarding]: https://wiki.gnupg.org/AgentForwarding

Client System

Assuming system is running MacOS install [gpg][] and pinentry (GPG
password prompt tool) using [Homebrew][],

  [gpg]: https://gnupg.org/
  [Homebrew]: https://brew.sh/

    brew install gnupg pinentry-mac

~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf

    default-cache-ttl 600
    max-cache-ttl 7200
    enable-ssh-support
    pinentry-program /usr/local/bin/pinentry-mac

~/.gnupg/gpg.conf (where $GPG_KEY is the fingerprint of the GPG key to
use)

    default-key $GPG_KEY
    personal-digest-preferences SHA512
    cert-digest-algo SHA512
    default-preference-list SHA512 SHA384 SHA256 SHA224 AES256 AES192 AES CAST5 ZLIB BZIP2 ZIP Uncompressed
    no-emit-version

Edit ~/.ssh/config and setup a RemoteForward, this is important since
the forward is required in order for the two gpg-agents to communicate
over a socket. Make sure the $UID and $USER on the remote and local
system are set accordingly, as these will differ depending on the OS
and login.

Also double check the socket names, as sometimes they it can be
something like S.gpg-agent.extra but other times S.gpg-agent-extra,
note the differences with . and - and always double check as these are
easy to miss and will cause agent forwarding to not work.

~/.ssh/config

    Host $REMOTE_IP
       ForwardAgent yes
       Compression yes
       ForwardX11 yes
       RemoteForward /run/user/$UID/gnupg/S.gpg-agent /Users/${USER}/.gnupg/S.gpg-agent.extra

Remote System

Update /etc/ssh/sshd_config (or wherever it is depending on your OS)
configuration to include StreamLocalBindUnlink yes and restart
sshdThis option will,

  Specifies whether to remove an existing Unix-domain socket file for
  local or remote port forwarding before creating a new one. If the
  socket file already exists and StreamLocalBindUnlink is not enabled,
  ssh will be unable to forward the port to the Unix-domain socket
  file. This option is only used for port forwarding to a Unix-domain
  socket file.

Troubleshooting gpg-agent

Sometimes StreamLocalBindUnlink yes doesnâ€™t work and the client agent
needs restarted and sockets removed from the remote system,

Restart the agent on the client system,

    gpg-connect-agent reloadagent /bye

Remove the socket on the remote system,

    rm /run/user/1000/gnupg/S.gpg-agent

ssh back into the remote system and gpg-agent forwarding should work
again.
