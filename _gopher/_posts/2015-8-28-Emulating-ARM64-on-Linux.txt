title: Emulating ARM64 on Linux

Over the last few years Iâ€™ve [championed][] the ultra-low-power and
high-density of a [64-bit ARM platform][] in the datacenter. The
promise of thousands of cores all sipping power and taking up less
room than the equivalent Intel architecture to me is both exciting and
pragmatic as a large systems IT engineer.

Combining with the simplicity of a [microservices architecture][] with
the advantages of [immutable infrastructure][] running across a
sea-of-[containers][] and you have an extremely agile development and
operations platform.

Working for a [semiconductor company][] specializing in [ARM
Architecture][] unfortuantely does not guarentee me access to this
exciting new tech ([yet][]), but through the wonders of emulation
bringing up a development environment is just a few commands away.

The following gist contains the steps on standing up a emulated ARM64
virtual machine either with [Ubuntu][] or [Debian][Ubuntu] operating
system. This should be enough for anyone wanting to tinker with an
ARM64 before getting their hands on real hardware.

The biggest downside of this approach is while you can assign as much
memory to QEMU as the host system has available, it is bound to only
one CPU, which combined with the emulation environment leads to
extremely slow performancen on CPU intensive tasks.
